# 🚀 Breaking My Comfort Zone: From Express.js to NestJS

As a **full-stack developer**, working across both the frontend and backend has given me a holistic view of web development. But when it comes to personal preference, **backend development has always been my strong suit**.

For a long time, I used **Express.js** as my go-to framework for building APIs and server-side applications. It's fast, minimalist, and easy to get started with — and it served me well in many projects. But over time, I began to notice a problem.

## 🧩 Getting Too Comfortable with Express.js

With Express, I could quickly scaffold projects and deliver features. But once I moved beyond simple APIs and started working on more complex systems, I realized that **Express lacks structure by default**.

I found myself rewriting the same boilerplate:

- Routing logic
- Manual dependency management
- Repetitive folder structures
- Middleware patterns for each project

Despite knowing this, I stuck with Express because it was familiar. I had unknowingly settled into a **comfort zone** — and that’s where my growth slowed down.

## 👀 Discovering NestJS (And Getting Intimidated)

At some point, I came across **NestJS**, a modern Node.js framework built with **TypeScript** and powered by **Express** or **Fastify** under the hood.

But when I opened the documentation for the first time, I felt completely lost.

It introduced concepts I wasn’t used to in JavaScript frameworks:

- **Controllers**
- **Services**
- **Providers**
- **Dependency Injection**
- **Modules**
- **Decorators**

My first thought? _“This looks way too complex for what I need.”_  
So, I closed the tab — and continued using Express.

## 🔁 Giving NestJS Another Shot

Recently, I decided to revisit NestJS, but this time with a new mindset.

I stopped comparing it to Express directly and instead tried to understand **why** NestJS does what it does. What I found surprised me — the complexity I feared was actually there to help me.

Here's what I realized:

### 🔧 NestJS CLI in Action (With Explanations)

```bash
# Install the NestJS CLI globally
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

Installs the official NestJS CLI. This tool helps you quickly scaffold a project with best practices built-in — no manual boilerplate required.

```bash
# Create a new NestJS project
nest new project-name
```

Sets up a complete NestJS project with TypeScript, a clean folder structure, pre-configured tooling (like ESLint, Jest, and Prettier), and ready-to-use modules. It saves hours of manual setup.

```bash
# Generate a controller
nest g controller user
```

Creates a UserController that handles incoming HTTP requests related to the user resource (like GET /users, POST /users, etc.).
Think of it as the entry point for client-facing HTTP routes.

```bash
# Generate a module
nest g module user
```

Generates a UserModule, which acts as a container for related components like controllers and services.
This encapsulation supports modular and scalable code organization — ideal for large codebases.

```bash
# Generate a service
nest g service user
```

Creates a UserService where all your reusable business logic lives (e.g., database operations, computations, or third-party integrations).
It can be easily injected into the controller or other services using NestJS’s built-in Dependency Injection.

## ✅ Why NestJS Makes Sense Now

| **Feature**                   | **Benefit**                                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TypeScript-first**          | Type-safe development with better IDE support            |
| **Modular architecture**      | Organized and isolated feature domains                   |
| **Dependency Injection**      | Cleaner service reuse and easier testing                 |
| **Built-in tooling**          | CLI generators for modules, controllers, and services    |
| **Flexible transport layers** | Support for REST, GraphQL, WebSockets, and Microservices |

## 💡 What I Learned

- **Familiar doesn’t mean better**: Comfort zones can slow down growth.
- **NestJS isn’t complex — it’s structured**: Once you understand the architecture, it becomes very intuitive.
- **Frameworks shape how we think**: NestJS encourages clean code, separation of concerns, and scalable design from day one.

## 🧭 Final Thoughts

If you're a developer who's been working with Express for a while and looking to level up your backend skills, I strongly recommend giving **NestJS** a chance.

At first, it might feel different — even difficult. But once you embrace the structure it offers, you'll find that your code becomes **cleaner**, **more maintainable**, and **ready for scale**.

> **Growth begins when you step outside what’s familiar.**
